                <h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
                <h2 id="qu">1. How does NCNN Upscaling work?</h2>
                <p id="an">NCNN Upscaling uses advanced neural networks to enhance image quality by increasing resolution and restoring details. These models are designed to process pixel patterns in the input image and generate a higher-quality output. By leveraging the NCNN framework, the upscaling algorithm runs efficiently on various devices, utilizing either the CPU or GPU for computation.</p>

                <h2 id="qu">2. Why is NCNN Upscaling done client-side?</h2>
                <p id="an">Performing the upscaling process on the client's computer ensures greater privacy, as no images are uploaded to a remote server. Additionally, there are no limitations on the size or number of images you can upscale since the processing power comes from your own hardware. This approach provides users with full control and flexibility.</p>

                <h2 id="qu">3. What is the other purpose of NCNN Upscaling?</h2>
                <p id="an">One of the main goals of NCNN Upscaling is to promote the adoption and development of open-source software. By making these tools accessible to everyone, it encourages collaboration and innovation. Furthermore, it provides an alternative to server-based upscaling solutions, empowering users to work offline and with their own devices.</p>

                <h2 id="qu">4. Are there alternatives to NCNN Upscaling?</h2>
                <p id="an">Yes, there are alternatives to NCNN Upscaling. For example, websites like Waifu2x.net offer server-side processing for image upscaling. However, these services often have limitations, such as file size restrictions or requiring internet connectivity. On the other hand NCNN Upscaling also has their downloadable tools that can be used by yourself, tools like Real-ESRGAN and Real-CUGAN can utilize the GPU over Vulkan or CUDA on your device for faster processing and more advanced features.</p>
